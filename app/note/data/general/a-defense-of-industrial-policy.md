# A Defense of Industrial Policy

> The theoretical case for industrial policy is a strong one. The market failures which
industrial policies target — in markets for credit, labor, products, and knowledge —
have long been at the core of what development economists study.

- Does industrial policy work?
- Does industrial policy pick winners?

        - R&D Agent → Add a More Deep Structure
        - Financial Agent → Add a More Deep Structure

            - Sectorial Organization → Division of Labor
            - Network Structure → Matrix → Products (Underlying Technology)
        - Labor Market Structure → Add a deep structure (Model this a a Pool)

## **Economical Productive Configuration**

```python
# Re-import necessary libraries after execution environment reset
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Initialize directed graph
G = nx.DiGraph()

# Define main nodes and their attributes
core_node = "Economic Productive Configuration"
main_nodes = ["R&D Agent", "Financial Agent", "Firms Agent", "Labor Market Structure"]

# Add the core node
G.add_node(core_node)

# Add main nodes and connections to the core node
for node in main_nodes:
    G.add_node(node)
    G.add_edge(core_node, node)

# Define additional nodes and connections for each main agent
sub_nodes = {
    "R&D Agent": ["Deep Structure (Innovation Layers)", "Link to Financial Agent", "Link to Firms Agent"],
    "Financial Agent": ["Deep Structure (Capital Sources)", "Link to R&D Agent", "Link to Firms Agent", "Link to Labor Market Structure"],
    "Firms Agent": ["Sectorial Links (Agriculture, Technology)", "Value Chains", "Link to Labor Market Structure", "Link to Financial Agent"],
