# Production Function

> A **production function** is the epistemic representation form that maps productive inputs — labor, capital, land, materials, energy — into output under a given technology. As a fitted structural equation (Cobb–Douglas, CES, translog) it is a concrete claim about input substitution, returns to scale, and technical change; as an unfitted form it is the blueprint constraining which such claims can be built at all.

## Formulation

### What epistemic element type does this epistemic instance belong to?

**Production Function belongs to the `Epistemic Representation Form (Epistemic Blueprint)` epistemic element type — the encoding format constraining how artifacts about production are built, manipulated, and interpreted.**

It is a form, not an instance: `y = AK^αL^β` with fitted coefficients is a `Concrete Epistemic Artifact`; the Cobb–Douglas family — its functional shape, its elasticity and homogeneity properties, its estimability conditions — is the blueprint. The same blueprint–artifact split holds for every functional form below: the form states what *can* be claimed, the fitted instance states what *is* claimed and is evaluable against reality.

### What is this epistemic instance?

> The mapping from an input vector to an output scalar (or vector) expressing technological feasibility: what combinations of inputs can produce what output, at what substitution cost, and with what returns to scale. Its empirical content lives in three derived objects — input elasticities, the returns-to-scale measure, and the residual (total factor productivity).

**Layer.** Noetic — the function is a descriptive instrument; the production process it models is Ontic, and the estimated coefficients are validated against observed input–output records.

**Purpose.** Explanation (why output moves with inputs), prediction (counterfactual input choices), and control (cost minimization, productivity policy).

### What is the recursive instance decomposition of this epistemic instance?

> Boundary: one representation form, decomposed at middle depth — inputs, forms, technology, estimation, and validation branches. Fitted instances appear as exemplars only.
>
> Stopping rule: a row is terminal when it names a factor, a functional form, an estimator, a standard, or a derived object.
>
> Identity: Instance Tree Path is the stable identifier of each row; every path is unique.
