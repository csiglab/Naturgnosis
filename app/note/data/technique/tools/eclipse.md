# Eclipse

> Eclipse is a versioned desktop IDE product instance — a Java-based, OSGi-composed workbench for editing, building, debugging, and extending software, above all Java.
>
> It is the complement of the command line and the bare build: the workspace returns fast, managed feedback (problems view, incremental build, debugger with source lookup) while the `Bundle` persists as the unit of functionality, claimed and wired by the Equinox runtime through the extension registry.
>
> This note characterizes Eclipse as a full ensemble — distribution, OSGi runtime, workbench, JDT, PDE, help, Maven bridge, configuration, practices, and evolution — following the schema in [Philosophia Artium Technicarum et Operis](note.html?n=meta/philosophia-artium-technicarum-et-operis.md).

## Formulation

### What technical element type does this technical instance belong to?

**Eclipse belongs to the `Production Technical System` technical element type, readable as a `Technical Element Set`.**

More specifically:

```text
Production Technical System
└── Eclipse (IDE distribution + OSGi runtime + workbench + JDT/PDE + RCP host)
    readable as Technical Element Set (distribution + bundles + workbench + tooling + practices)
```

Eclipse is a technical system because it is an organized composition of a provisioned distribution, an OSGi runtime with a bundle dependency graph and extension registry, a workbench of perspectives/views/editors, language tooling (JDT), plugin tooling (PDE), help and build bridges, configuration, management mechanisms, and update practices that collectively provide a development environment. A team *provisions* a distribution; the runtime *claims* and wires bundles; the workbench *realizes* perspectives. As a coherent body of objects + techniques + knowledge + institutions organized around one capability — develop, build, debug, and extend software from one workbench — it is also a `Technical Element Set`.

### What is this technical instance?

> Eclipse is a concrete, versioned desktop IDE technical system instance: a Java-VM-hosted, Equinox-OSGi-composed workbench of perspectives, views, and file-type-bound editors, with JDT (own compiler, incremental builder, refactoring, debugger), PDE (plugin develop/build/test tooling, PDE Build), Lucene-indexed help, and a Maven bridge — extensible through installable plugins and reusable as a Rich Client Platform for standalone applications.

Lineage: IBM VisualAge Micro Edition compiler contribution → Eclipse platform in Java, Eclipse Foundation stewardship → plugins described by `plugin.xml` become OSGi bundles with manifest metadata (Equinox) → 3.x stream → 4.x (e4) workbench.

### What is the recursive instance decomposition of this technical instance?

> Boundary: this table decomposes one Eclipse IDE installation instance (distribution, runtime structure, workbench, tooling, configuration surface, practices); deployment-specific values appear only in rows marked exemplar.
>
> Stopping rule: a row is terminal when it names a concrete file, directory, command, configuration attribute, measured value, URL, stack frame, or named actor; attribute slots (Profile, Version, Path) are terminal by rule.
>
> Identity: Instance Tree Path is the stable identifier of each row; every path in this table is unique.
>
> Verbs: a team *provisions* a distribution; the runtime *claims* and wires bundles; a plugin *extends* an extension point; the workbench *realizes* perspectives; JDT *embodies* the incremental-build technique.

## QA

### What is the difference between native and emulated widget toolkits, and why is SWT native?

> A native widget toolkit uses operating-system calls to build interface components such as lists and push buttons, leaving interaction handling to the operating system. Its widgets are "pixel perfect": they look and feel like their counterparts in other desktop applications, and OS vendors' look-and-feel updates arrive for free. The cost is portability — underlying OS widget implementations differ vastly, producing inconsistencies. An emulated toolkit implements components outside the OS (drawing, focus, mouse and keyboard itself): highly portable and flexible — modern native toolkits such as Windows Presentation Framework are equally flexible — but early emulated toolkits were slow and looked out of place; Smalltalk-80 programs were recognizable at a glance, which hurt acceptance. SWT is native: Eclipse defers to the OS, which is why platform quirks (such as the WebKit/GTK DMABUF renderer issue) surface in Eclipse directly.
>

### Why did the JDT team write its own compiler instead of using `javac`?

> The team started from a compiler code contribution from VisualAge Micro Edition and planned to build tooling on top of the compiler, so owning the compiler was the logical decision. It also let JDT committers provide extension points for extending the compiler — impossible if the compiler were a third-party command-line application.
>

### Is a plugin the same as a bundle?

> Yes. With the switch to OSGi, Eclipse plugins became known as bundles: a plugin and a bundle are the same thing — a modular subset of functionality describing itself with metadata in a manifest. A plugin is a JAR with a manifest stating its identity, its dependencies, and how it can be utilized or extended.
>

### What are extensions and extension points?

> They are the other element of the Eclipse component model besides plugins. An extension point is a declared point at which a plugin can be extended (editors, views, builders); an extension is a contribution plugged into such a point by some plugin. The extension registry matches the two at runtime.
>

### How does Eclipse resolve Maven dependencies?

> Through the Maven bridge (m2e): `mvn eclipse:eclipse` generates Eclipse project metadata from a Maven project (`mvn eclipse:clean` reverts it), and `mvn dependency:sources` fetches dependency sources for debugger attachment. Dependency lookup therefore starts from the root Maven project and follows its declared dependencies.
>

### Why does adding `~/.m2/repository` as a source folder fail?

> Eclipse Debug Source Lookup does not recursively scan `~/.m2/repository` for matching `*-sources.jar` files. Source resolution follows the launch's source lookup path — project sources, classpath entries, and explicitly attached external archives — so adding the whole repository as a source folder changes nothing at suspend time: the debugger still reports "source not found". `mvn dependency:sources` only fetches the `*-sources.jar` files into the repository; they take effect when attached per artifact — through the Maven Dependencies container (m2e source attachment) or manual attachment of the specific sources jar — not through the repository directory itself. That is also why project sources and debugging sources are treated differently: the former feed the incremental builder, the latter feed the lookup path at the suspended frame.
>

### Why does the debugger show "source not found", and how is it fixed?

> The debugger suspends on bytecode with no attached source. Fix order: work from the root Maven project, regenerate metadata with `mvn clean eclipse:eclipse`, fetch sources with `mvn dependency:sources`, and if resolution still fails, attach the sources manually.
>

### How does debug source resolution work?

> Debugging needs a bytecode-to-source mapping per launch. Resolution order: project sources first — the root Maven project and its modules, since sources and dependencies follow the project and its dependencies — then dependency sources fetched via `mvn dependency:sources`, else manually attached sources. Project sources and debugging sources are treated differently in Eclipse: the former drive the incremental build and problem markers, the latter drive the debugger's source lookup at a suspended frame (exemplar: `AbstractSharedSessionContract.checkOpenOrWaitingForAutoClose()`). When lookup fails, the debugger reports "source not found".
>

### Why do attached sources sometimes fail to link in the Debug view?

> Because Eclipse links debug classes to sources by the **exact runtime class container and class identity**, not merely by Maven `groupId:artifactId:version`. Attaching the `*-sources.jar` of the Maven artifact is not enough when the class at the suspended frame came from somewhere else: with WildFly/JBoss Modules, the class may be loaded from a different JAR or module classloader — or a different build — than the Maven artifact whose sources you attached, so the lookup finds no match and the Debug view still shows no source. The fix is to attach the sources to the container that actually provided the runtime class (the module or JAR on the server's classpath), not just to the Maven-coordinate artifact.
>

### How do Run/Debug configurations work?

> A Run/Debug configuration is a named launch definition holding the main type, classpath, arguments, and JRE for one launchable unit; the debugger then steps through project and dependency code using the source resolution above.
>

### What are perspectives, views, editors, workspaces, and profiles?

> The workbench is the familiar UI shell organizing how Eclipse appears on the desktop. Editors are associated with file types, so the correct editor launches when a file opens; a view (such as the Problems view) shows errors or warnings; editors and views together form a perspective presenting tooling in an organized fashion. The workspace is the user's working area of projects and settings; a profile is the list of UIs in an installation.
>

### What is `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1` and when is it needed?

> A workaround for a WebKit/GTK renderer fault under SWT's native bindings: setting the variable disables the DMABUF renderer path that breaks Eclipse rendering on affected Linux desktops. Upstream tracker: eclipse.platform.swt issue 1108.
