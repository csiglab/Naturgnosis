## Formulation

### What technical element type does this technical instance belong to?

**Jakarta EE belongs to the `Technical Standard` technical element type — a set of specs.**

More specifically:

```text
Technical Standard
└── Jakarta EE (umbrella standard — set of member specs)
```

Jakarta EE is a standard because it is a normative specification governing form, function, interoperability, and behavior of enterprise Java artifacts. It is itself a set: member specs (Servlet, JPA, CDI, …) are nested standards grouped in families (Web Tier, Persistence, …). An implementation (e.g. Weld, Hibernate) *implements* a spec; a compatible server (e.g. WildFly, Payara, Tomcat with extensions) *realizes* the set. As a coherent body of standards + objects + techniques + institutions it can also be read as a `Technical Element Set`; the Standard typing is kept primary here.

### What is this technical instance?

> Jakarta EE is a specification-driven, enterprise-grade Java platform instance defining a set of standardized APIs, runtime environments, and container-managed services for building distributed, scalable, and transactional applications — implemented by providers (Hibernate, Weld, RESTEasy, Mojarra, …) and realized by compatible application/web servers (WildFly, Payara, GlassFish, Open Liberty, Tomcat with EE extensions).

### What is the recursive instance decomposition of this technical instance?

> Boundary: this table decomposes the Jakarta EE standard set — member specs under Specification (spec documents, API surfaces, standard-enabled practices), plus conformance control, governance, and realizing servers; vendor implementations are documented in the Implementation matrix below, not here. Deployment-specific values appear only in rows marked exemplar.
>
> Stopping rule: a row is terminal when it names a concrete spec document version, a `jakarta.*` API package, a TCK result, a config file, or a named server distribution.
>
> Identity: Instance Tree Path is the stable identifier of each row; every path in this table is unique.
>
> Verbs: a compatible server *realizes* the standard set.

## Specification Set

> Java EE (Jakarta EE) is a specification-driven, enterprise-grade Java platform that defines a set of standardized APIs, runtime environments, and container-managed services for building distributed, scalable, and transactional applications, leveraging a component-based architecture with servlets, JSP, JSF, CDI, EJB, JPA, JMS, JTA, and web services (REST and SOAP) while enforcing dependency injection, declarative security, and multi-threaded request processing within managed execution environments such as application servers (e.g., WildFly, Payara, or **Tomcat with EE extensions**).

## Implementation

### Which servers realize the specifications?

> Support Levels reflect this note's sourced rows — not official certification (certification lives with the TCK process and the jakarta.ee compatibility listings). `*` marks levels limited by unsourced rows rather than proven absence: an empty pivot cell means unsourced, never incapable.

| Java EE Implementor (Server) | Description | Support Level |
|---|---|---|
| WildFly | Modular full-profile application server; decomposed in the WildFly note. | Full Platform |
| JBoss EAP | Hardened, commercially supported WildFly derivative. | Full Platform |
| Payara Server | Full-platform server from the GlassFish lineage. | Full Platform |
| GlassFish | Eclipse reference implementation server. | Full Platform |
| Open Liberty | Feature-based runtime; profiles composed per deployment. | Web Profile* |
| TomEE | Tomcat base with OpenEJB/OpenWebBeans/ActiveMQ additions. | Web Profile* |
| Apache Tomcat | Servlet container with JSP/EL support. | Servlet Container |
| Jetty | Servlet container. | Servlet Container |

### Which implementations realize each specification on each server?

> Pivot of the Implementation Sets in the Specification Set above, with the WildFly column refined from the WildFly note's subsystem table (hence Undertow/EJB3/Elytron instead of the shared defaults). Empty cell = unsupported on that server or not yet sourced — never a claim. Server columns are ordered most-complete-first. Open Liberty and GlassFish are omitted from this pivot (see the server table for their support levels); their sourced cells matched the shared defaults. Server profiles vary (see WildFly/Tomcat notes).

## Evolution

> Java EE (1999, Sun) → Java EE 5–8 under JCP → 2017 transfer to Eclipse Foundation → Jakarta EE 8 (same as Java EE 8) → Jakarta EE 9 (namespace rename `javax.*` → `jakarta.*`) → 9.1/10/11 (profiles: Platform, Web, Core). Each step keeps the spec → implementation → realization chain: specs versioned, implementations re-certified via TCK, servers re-released per profile.

## **Jakarta Faces**

QA:

- How events are handle?
- How data binding works?
- How partial updates works?
- What is the execution model?
- How `DemuxCompositeELResolver` works?
- What is the different between `Jakarta EE Server` vs `Application Server`?

Phases:

- com.sun.faces.lifecycle.RestoreViewPhase@4793eed2
- com.sun.faces.lifecycle.ApplyRequestValuesPhase@4f2666db
- com.sun.faces.lifecycle.ProcessValidationsPhase@382e51f1
- com.sun.faces.lifecycle.UpdateModelValuesPhase@26a93b9b
- com.sun.faces.lifecycle.InvokeApplicationPhase@7e14a4e2 -> Use dr.gov.esigef.pds.presentacion.nucleo.evento.EventoEjecutadoCambioValor@42185d63
- com.sun.faces.lifecycle.RenderResponsePhase@2f80545

Expression Language (EL):

- Unified EL resolves `#{bean.prop}` against CDI-managed beans via the container EL resolver chain (see `DemuxCompositeELResolver` question above); values set during Update-Model-Values, rendered during Render-Response.

## QA

- How does WildFly determine which **JSP** file to serve for a given **URL**, and where must the **JSP** be located inside the **WAR**?
