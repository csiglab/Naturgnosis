# Food Production Technical Domain

> The **Food Production Technical Domain** is the super-domain that composes every technique for turning a biological organism into a harvestable food product. It is not a practice of its own: it is the scope inside which the member sets sit, and its work is to say what they share, where each one begins, and where the domain stops.
>
> The cut is the harvest. What is in: the establishment and keeping of a standing crop, the breeding and editing that changes it, the health work that keeps it standing, and the animal systems that produce milk, meat, and seafood. What is out: everything that happens to the product after it leaves the organism — processing, preservation, packaging, cold chain, distribution, retail — which belongs to [Food Value Chain](note.html?n=technique/food-value-chain.md) and is deliberately not contained here. The knowledge the member sets produce is epistemic and lives in [Plant Science](note.html?n=epistemica/plant-science.md); the firms and the markets are social and production. Worked per [Philosophia Artium Technicarum et Operis](note.html?n=meta/philosophia-artium-technicarum-et-operis.md).

## Formulation

### What technical element type does this technical instance belong to?

**The Food Production Technical Domain belongs to the `Technical Element Set` technical element type — a collection of technical elements scoped to one bounded field, which here is primary food production.**

```text
Technical Element Set
└── Food Production Technical Domain (bounded field: organism → harvestable food product)
```

It is a set rather than a `Production Technical System` because it owns no plant, no herd, and no line: the members own those, and what this scope adds is the family and its boundary. That is the same move as the [Technical Core Catalog](note.html?n=technique/technical-core-catalog.md), which is the corpus's existing precedent for a set whose members are themselves sets; here the member family is the primary-production techniques rather than the transformation domains.

The `Technical Element Set` grouping below the root is admitted by the No-repetition exception: it scopes the instance family of the six member sets that would otherwise hang untyped off the root's own segment, and it appears exactly once. Composite members take the `Set` suffix at this depth. No row below carries two types.

**Why these six and not others.** [Agriculture Production](note.html?n=technique/agriculture-production.md) is deliberately **not** a member. It is the sector frame that binds crop and animal subsystems together as an industry, not a technique for producing food, and its own note is a five-row stub holding a banana plantation, a beef feedlot, and a precision field kit. Composing a technical domain out of a production frame would put the frame inside its own content. It stays a cross-link, and the sector view of the same material is held in the social and production spaces.

Secondary readings, kept as prose rather than compromise typing: a single farm, herd, or fishery is a `Production Technical System`; one mating, one application, or one rearing cycle is an `Operative Technique`; the soil, climate, and season the crop side works in are a `Technical Domain Reality Model`. Each takes its own root in its own decomposition.

### What is this technical instance?

> A super-domain, not a workshop: the crop member sets run breeding programmes, field operations, laboratories, and quarantine services; the animal member sets run herds, milking, capture, and culture; and this scope holds them together by the single transformation they perform — an organism is made to yield a product, on a schedule, to a specification.

**What the members share, and what they do not.** The shared thing is the transformation, not the species and not the technique. Plant Cultivation, Plant Genetic Improvement, and Plant Health are crop-side; Dairy, Meat, and Seafood are animal-side. They are one domain because a milk, a carcass, a fish, and a grain are produced the same way in form — organism, regime, harvest window, specification — even though the crop side is bounded by soil and season while the animal side is bounded by breeding, nutrition, health, and welfare. That difference is a real one and is carried in the reality model below rather than smoothed away.

**The state of the members, stated plainly.** This domain is composed of sets in two very different conditions. Three members are full decompositions: Plant Cultivation (87 rows), Plant Genetic Improvement (233), and Plant Health (205). Three are seed nodes of five to seven rows, imported and not yet worked: Dairy, Meat, and Seafood. The honest consequence is that the animal side of this domain is, today, processing chains rather than husbandry — a pasteurization line, a cheese vat, a slaughter line, a cutting floor, a filleting line — and that content overlaps what Food Value Chain already claims. So the domain as composed is deep on the crop side and thin on the animal side, and it says so rather than presenting an even frontage it does not have.

**The gap this creates, and its remedy.** Primary production on the animal side is uncovered: the husbandry sets — breeding, nutrition, health, welfare, housing, milking, capture, and culture — do not exist as decompositions, and until they do, the three animal members are downstream of harvest. The remedy is to write them, and the member rows above are shaped to receive them: each already names what it holds and what it is currently missing. The Animal Side Coverage Requirement below records the gap as a requirement on the domain rather than leaving it to a reader to notice.

Lineage: foraging and domestication → selection without theory → controlled mating and pedigrees → hybrid vigour and systematic crossing → the chemical and input era that produced the twentieth-century yield gains → molecular markers and genomic prediction → targeted editing and de novo domestication, with the parallel animal line running from controlled breeding and artificial insemination to confinement and intensive production.

### What is the recursive instance decomposition of this technical instance?

> Boundary: one super-domain, decomposed at shallow depth — the root, its six members, and the spine that states what the members share (evolution, purpose, reality model, the requirements and standards the whole field is bounded by). No member is re-decomposed here: each has its own note, and repeating a member's contents inside its parent is duplication, not structure.
>
> Typing reads directly from the instance path: the members resolve to the enclosing `Technical Element Set` grouping; the spine lands on flat facet types. Expansion is licensed by `(root) -> <<Technical Element>> -> ... -> Technical Element Set`, the recursion rule for that composite. Every backticked type segment groups instances and terminates on none; every leaf resolves to a technical instance.

| `Technical Element Set` → Food Production Technical Domain → `Technical Purpose` | Grouping: the technical purpose of this domain. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Food Production Technical Domain → `Technical Purpose` → Nourishment Purpose | The domain's end: food, in quantity and in quality, from a biological organism rather than from a wild source. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Food Production Technical Domain → `Technical Purpose` → Stability Purpose | Yield and quality that hold across sites and seasons, so that production is a practice rather than a run of fortunes. |

| `Technical Element Set` → Food Production Technical Domain → `Technical Domain Reality Model` → Field And Barn Reality | The operative model of the crop side: soil, climate, and season bounding what a plant can be made to yield. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Food Production Technical Domain → `Technical Domain Reality Model` → Herd And Flock Reality | The operative model of the animal side: breeding, nutrition, health, and welfare bounding what an animal can be made to yield, which is why it is a different technical problem from the same transformation. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Food Production Technical Domain → `Technical Domain Reality Model` → Seasonal Production Window | The operative model both sides share: a window in which the product can be taken, and which cannot be widened by technique alone. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Food Production Technical Domain → `Technical Requirement` | Grouping: the technical requirement of this domain. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Food Production Technical Domain → `Technical Requirement` → Harvestability Requirement | The product must be in a state that can be taken from the organism and delivered — the requirement that separates primary production from keeping an organism alive. |
