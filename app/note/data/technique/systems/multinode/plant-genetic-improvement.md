# Plant Genetic Improvement

> **Plant Genetic Improvement** is the set of practices that turns germplasm into a new variety. It is not one method: breeding, marker and genomic tooling, transformation, genome editing, testing, seed production, and the regulation that admits the lot are separate practices held together by one purpose, and any of them alone yields no sellable variety. Framing: the Spanish encyclopedia article [Mejoramiento genético](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mejoramiento_gen%C3%A9tico) — increase productivity, resistance, adaptation and product quality by modifying the genotype, managing genetic resources by selection, and conserving long-term variability. That article carries a maintenance banner for missing published references, so it is used here as orientation and every technical claim is anchored in the literature listed in [References](#references); its bibliography is the source of the historical works below.
>
> The plant half of the article's scope is the cut: animal breeding is out. What is also out: the crop regime the variety is planted into ([Plant Cultivation](note.html?n=technique/systems/multinode/plant-cultivation-technical-domain-set.md)), the inquiry that warrants knowing the genotype and the phenotype ([Plant Science](note.html?n=epistemica/plant-science.md)), and the institutions that own and certify the seed (social, not technical here). The plant as a living system is natural; this note decomposes the apparatus that changes it, not the organism ([Ambiguity Resolution](note.html?n=meta/ambiguity-resolution.md)).

## Formulation

### What technical element type does this technical instance belong to?

**Plant Genetic Improvement belongs to the `Technical Element Set` technical element type — a collection of technical elements scoped to one bounded field, which here is the production of a new variety.**

Technical Element Set
└── Plant Genetic Improvement (bounded field: turn germplasm into a released variety)
```

The taxonomy defines no `Technical Practice Set` or `Improvement` type: such names are generic composites, and the generic type is `Technical Element Set`, whose specific semantics are carried by the particular set rather than by the type. It is a set and not a single `General Technique` because a crossing, an editor, a trial network, and a seed plant are different technical element types that only co-operate inside the program that holds them. The `Technical Element Set` grouping below the root is admitted by the No-repetition exception: it scopes the instance family of the eight practice sets that would otherwise hang untyped off the root's own segment, and it appears exactly once.

Its members are of different types by necessity — `General Technique` crossing and editing, `Constitutive Technical Object` vectors and germplasm, `Technical Mechanism` trait and marker linkage, `Production Technical System` the breeding program, `Technical Standard` certification and biosafety, `Technical Institution` the bank and the authority — and are coherent as a set because all of them serve one end: a variety that can be grown, certified, and sold.

Secondary readings, kept as prose rather than compromise typing: the whole program as a facility is a `Production Technical System` (the crossing block, nursery, trial network, and seed plant working as one installation); one mating or one transformation performed on a stated parent is an `Operative Technique`; the site, season, and pathogen population the selection must satisfy are a `Technical Domain Reality Model`. Each takes its own root in its own decomposition; no row below carries two types.

### What is this technical instance?

> A breeder, a biotechnologist, a molecular geneticist, a trial statistician, a seed technician, and a regulator working one accession from germplasm to certified seed: crossing and selection or marker and genomic prediction or transformation and editing to reach the trait, multi-location trials to read it against a target population of environments, release and seed multiplication to deliver it, and the standards and institutions that make the lot admissible. The ends are fixed — yield stability, resistance, adaptation range, product quality, and the conservation of the variability the next cycle will need — and the method is chosen per end, per species, and per regulatory regime.

Why the method varies, in the article's own terms: the plant must first be shown to carry usable variation, and where natural variation is insufficient the variation is created — by intra- or interspecific hybridization, by heterosis, by mutation, by polyploidy induction, by somatic hybridization, or by genetic engineering. Inter-populational variation carries the adaptive traits; intra-populational variation carries the economic traits. The resistance targets split biotic (insects, fungi, bacteria, viruses) from abiotic (climate and edaphic: salinity, extreme heat and cold, water deficit, photoperiod, frost). The market targets split organoleptic from quantitative (protein, oil) from post-harvest life. Those three splits are what the trait-target set below is organized along, and they are why this is a set of practices: each split selects a different technical route.

Lineage: domestication and farmer selection → mass, line, and pedigree selection with written pedigrees → controlled hybridization and heterosis in the field → cytogenetics, polyploidy, and mutation breeding → molecular markers and marker-assisted selection → transformation of the nuclear genome → genome editing, and with it de novo domestication of a wild genome without a single cross.

### What is the recursive instance decomposition of this technical instance?

> Boundary: one practice ensemble, decomposed at middle depth — the shared spine (purpose, requirement, evolution), eight practice sets worked to instance leaves, and no deployment exemplars. A branch that would need a concrete cultivar, event, or seed lot takes one in its own decomposition.
>
> Typing reads from the instance path: each set resolves to the enclosing `Technical Element Set` grouping, and everything below a set resolves to its nearest enclosing type segment. Expansion is licensed by `(root) -> <<Technical Element>> -> ... -> Technical Element Set`. Every backticked type segment groups instances and terminates on none; every leaf resolves to a technical instance.

## QA

### What techniques enable plant genome modification, and what biological processes are used to regenerate a genome-modified plant from the modified cells?

> **Part one — the techniques that change the genome.** Modification starts by getting DNA, or a cutting device, into a living plant cell; the routes are `Agrobacterium-Mediated Transformation` (with `Binary Vector Delivery` and `Floral Dip Transformation`), where the soil bacterium carries the `T-DNA Border And Linker` and the `Trait Cassette` into the nucleus (Klümper & Munkvold, 1998; Innes et al., 1994); `Biolistic Transformation`, for tissue or species the bacterium will not take; `Protoplast Transformation`, for large inserts into wall-less cells; and `Chloroplast Transformation`, which edits the maternal plastid genome and buys high expression with containment that nuclear transformation does not give. From there the technique no longer adds a gene but rewrites one: `Cas9 Nuclease Editing` cuts a guide-matched site and lets non-homologous joining turn the cut into a knockout, or uses the cell's own repair to `Knock-In By Homology-Directed Repair` from a supplied template (Jinek et al., 2012; Cong et al., 2013); `Base Editing` and `Prime Editing` change a stated base and a stated sequence without a double-strand break (Komor et al., 2016; Anzalone et al., 2019); `Multiplex Editing` runs several guides at once, and `TALEN Editing` is the alternative programmable cutter (Belhaj et al., 2013). `De Novo Domestication` is the same machinery aimed the other way — rewriting a wild or unadapted genome into a crop genome, trait by trait, with no crossing at all (McCallum et al., 2012). What makes each of these a technique rather than a wish is the apparatus that carries it: the constructs are `Constitutive Technical Object` (Binary Vector, T-DNA Border And Linker, Cas9 Expression Cassette, Single-Guide RNA, Selectable Marker Gene, Trait Cassette), the run is a `Technical Act` chain (Transform → Regenerate From Explant → Screen Transformed Line → Confirm Molecular Edit → Chimerism Test), and the yield of the run is declared as `Transformation Efficiency`, `Edit Efficiency`, `Off-Target Rate`, and `Regeneration Success Rate`.
>
> **Part two — the biology that gets a modified cell back into a plant.** The tree above names the regeneration *operations* — `Somatic Embryogenesis And Regeneration`, `Selection And Regeneration Medium`, `Regenerate From Explant`, `Chimerism Test` — but not the processes that make them work; those are given here, because they are the reason a plant and not a bacterium is the substrate of this whole set. The premise is **totipotency**: a differentiated plant cell keeps the complete genome, so one transformed somatic cell carries everything needed to rebuild the organism, and the whole problem reduces to making that cell divide, organize, and finish. The process has four stages.
>
> 1. **Dedifferentiation to callus.** An explant — a leaf disc, a cotyledon, an immature embryo, a root segment — is placed on a growth-regulator medium (auxin and cytokinin) and reverts to an unpatterned, rapidly dividing cell mass. This is the stage at which the construct or the cut is retained, and at which *every* cell is a potential founder, which is why the transformation event is diluted here and must be resolved later.
> 2. **Re-differentiation, by one of two routes.**
>
>    | Route | Sequence | Typical use |
>    | --- | --- | --- |
>    | **Somatic embryogenesis** | embryogenic callus → globular → heart → torpedo → cotyledonary embryo → maturation and desiccation | dicots; embryos come from single cells, so a regenerated plant is usually not chimeric |
>    | **Organogenesis** | shoot induction from callus → rooting of the shoot → hardening | monocots, and species whose embryogenic route is unreliable |
>
>    Both routes end at the same boundary: an in-vitro plantlet that is physiologically adapted to a sterile, humid, low-light plate, not to a field.
> 3. **Selection and chimera resolution.** The `Selection And Regeneration Medium` — a selectable marker plus the matching agent — kills the cells that did not take the construct, which is what makes the modified cell *the* founder of the regenerated plant rather than one cell among many. Where the event is not fixed in the meristem, the regenerated plant is a mosaic: two tissues may differ, and only the transformed sector is heritable. `Chimerism Test` establishes which case you have, and the fix is to sub-clone — take an axillary bud or a single somatic embryo — until the plant is uniform.
> 4. **Acclimatization.** The plantlet is weaned off the sterile medium: humidity down, light up, gradually, until the cuticle and the stomata can carry a normal transpiration load. This is the hand-off to cultivation, and it is the same operation the propagation practice calls `Hardening-Off` in [Plant Cultivation Technical Domain Set](note.html?n=technique/systems/multinode/plant-cultivation-technical-domain-set.md) — an improvement that ends at a test tube has delivered nothing.
>
> What bounds the whole sequence is the same for every route. **Recalcitrancy**: the response is species- and genotype-dependent, and the species that will not regenerate block every technique above, which is what `Regeneration Success Rate` registers. **Somaclonal variation**: the culture itself mutates the plant, so a regenerated line carries changes nobody asked for, and has to be crossed back into an elite background before it is a candidate — which is why an editing route is normally run together with a crossing programme from the Breeding Set. **Transgene silencing**: the plant can switch the introduced expression off after integration. And **transformation event chimerism**: one regenerated plant carrying more than one independent event, which then segregates unpredictably in the field.
