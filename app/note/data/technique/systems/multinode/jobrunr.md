# JobRunr

> JobRunr is an embeddable JVM library for durable, distributed background jobs — fire-and-forget, delayed, and recurring — written with plain Java methods.
>

> It is the complement of the request path: the web request returns fast while the `Job` persists as JSON in the application's existing database, is claimed and executed by a `BackgroundJobServer`, retried on failure, and observed in a built-in dashboard.
>

> This note characterizes JobRunr as a full ensemble — jobs, states, scheduler API, server cluster, storage providers, dashboard, filters, framework integrations, and practices (OSS plus a marked Pro sketch) — following the schema in [Philosophia Artium Technicarum et Operis](note.html?n=meta/philosophia-artium-technicarum-et-operis.md).

## Formulation

### What technical element type does this technical instance belong to?

**JobRunr belongs to the `Constitutive Technical Object` technical element type, readable as a `Technical Element Set`.**

More specifically:

```text
Constitutive Technical Object
└── JobRunr (embeddable background-processing library)
    readable as Technical Element Set (jobs + states + scheduler + server + storage + dashboard + filters + practices)
```

JobRunr is constitutive because it is built to be embedded in an existing application, constituting that application's background-processing subsystem — like a `database schema` or `bearing` in the taxonomy, it is a component of a larger technical object, not a standalone system. A host application *embeds* JobRunr; the scheduler *persists* jobs; a server *claims* and *realizes* them. The deployed ensemble (application + JobRunr + database + dashboard) can additionally be read as a `Production Technical System`. As a coherent body of objects + techniques + knowledge + institutions organized around one capability — durable background work on the JVM — it is also a `Technical Element Set`.

### What is this technical instance?

> JobRunr is a versioned, embeddable JVM library instance (Java 8+, Kotlin; OSS LGPL 3.0 plus commercial Pro) that turns plain Java methods — referenced via lambdas through `BackgroundJob`/`JobScheduler`, or via `JobRequest`/`JobRequestHandler` commands — into persisted, atomically claimed, automatically retried, dashboard-observable background jobs executed by a `BackgroundJobServer` cluster backed by the application's existing SQL or NoSQL database.

Lineage: Ronald Dehuysser, `jobrunr/jobrunr` on GitHub; Java alternative to HangFire (.NET), Sidekiq/Resque/delayed_job (Ruby), Celery (Python); persistent and distributed successor to Quartz and Spring Task Scheduler. Exemplar version in this note: 8.8.1 (`org.jobrunr:jobrunr`).

### What is the recursive instance decomposition of this technical instance?

> Boundary: this table decomposes one JobRunr-embedded application instance (library v8.x, one database, one server cluster, one dashboard); deployment-specific values appear only in rows marked exemplar.
>
> Stopping rule: a row is terminal when it names a concrete class, annotation, method, job state, database table, endpoint, config attribute, or named actor.
>
> Identity: Instance Tree Path is the stable identifier of each row; every path in this table is unique.
>
> Verbs: a host application *embeds* JobRunr; the scheduler *persists* a job; a server *claims* and *executes* it; Pro rows are marked `(Pro)`.

| Instance Tree Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Constitutive Technical Object` → JobRunr | Embeddable background-processing library instance plus its server, storage, dashboard, and practices. |
| `Constitutive Technical Object` → JobRunr → Coherence (One Persisted Job, Many Realizations) | Organizing structure: a single persisted `(root) -> <<Technical Element>> -> Technical Architecture` record drives scheduling, claiming, execution, retry, and observation. |
| `Constitutive Technical Object` → JobRunr → Realized Capability | Capability realized: durable, distributed background work on the JVM with no extra infrastructure. |
| `Constitutive Technical Object` → JobRunr → Governance (Author + Licenses) | Ronald Dehuysser authorship; `(root) -> <<Technical Element>> -> Technical Institution` on GitHub; LGPL 3.0 OSS plus commercial Pro tier. |
| `Constitutive Technical Object` → JobRunr → Distribution (Maven Central) | Versioned artifact `(root) -> <<Technical Element>> -> Production Technical System -> Production Technical Object -> Constitutive Technical Object` consumed via Maven or Gradle (exemplar 8.8.1). |

| `Constitutive Technical Object` → JobRunr → Job → JobDetails | Type, method to execute, and arguments extracted from the lambda via ASM and serialized to JSON. |
| `Constitutive Technical Object` → JobRunr → Job → Job Name | Human-readable name: `(root) -> <<Technical Element>> -> Technical Parameter` value, `JobBuilder` value, or derived default. |
| `Constitutive Technical Object` → JobRunr → Job → Job History | Ordered record of all states the job has passed through. |
| `Constitutive Technical Object` → JobRunr → Job → ENQUEUED State | Job waiting to be claimed by a server (`(root) -> <<Technical Element>> -> Technical Feedback`). |
| `Constitutive Technical Object` → JobRunr → Job → SCHEDULED State | Job waiting for its due moment (`(root) -> <<Technical Element>> -> Technical Feedback` with instant + reason). |
| `Constitutive Technical Object` → JobRunr → Job → PROCESSING State | Job currently claimed and executed by a server (`(root) -> <<Technical Element>> -> Technical Feedback` with server identity). |

| `Constitutive Technical Object` → JobRunr → JobScheduler | Injectable scheduler behind the static facade; preferable for testability. |
| `Constitutive Technical Object` → JobRunr → JobScheduler → Idempotent Creation | Creating a job with an already-existing id does not save it again. |

| `Constitutive Technical Object` → JobRunr → JobRequest Pattern → `JobRequest` | Interface carrying job data plus `getJobRequestHandler()`. |
| `Constitutive Technical Object` → JobRunr → JobRequest Pattern → `JobRequestHandler` | `run(request)` implementation performing the work. |

| `Constitutive Technical Object` → JobRunr → BackgroundJobServer | In-process server polling storage, atomically claiming jobs, and invoking target methods. |
| `Constitutive Technical Object` → JobRunr → BackgroundJobServer → Disabled By Default | Server and dashboard must be explicitly enabled. |

## Usage

> Three calls cover most needs; all persist a `Job` and return immediately.

```java
// Fire-and-forget: runs once, almost immediately
BackgroundJob.enqueue(() -> emailService.sendWelcomeEmail(userEmail));

// Delayed: runs once, 5 days from now — survives restarts
BackgroundJob.schedule(Instant.now().plus(5, ChronoUnit.DAYS), () -> emailService.sendFollowUp(userEmail));

// Recurring: runs on a cron schedule
BackgroundJob.scheduleRecurrently("daily-report", Cron.daily(), () -> reportService.sendDailyReport());
```

```java
// Configured: name with argument substitution + retry budget
@Job(name = "Send welcome email to %0", retries = 3)
public void sendWelcomeEmail(String userEmail) { ... }
```

```java
// Durable multi-step method: finished steps are skipped on retry
public void processOrder(UUID orderId, JobContext context) {
    context.runStepOnce("order-confirmation", () -> orderService.sendConfirmation(orderId));
    context.runStepOnce("warehouse-notification", () -> orderService.notifyWarehouse(orderId));
}
```
