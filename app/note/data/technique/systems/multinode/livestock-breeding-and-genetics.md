# Livestock Breeding And Genetics Set

> The **Livestock Breeding And Genetics Set** is the animal mirror of [Plant Genetic Improvement](note.html?n=technique/systems/multinode/plant-genetic-improvement.md). It changes the next generation rather than the current one: mating systems, selection, and the records that make selection possible. It is the member of [Animal Husbandry Technical Set](note.html?n=technique/systems/multinode/animal-husbandry-technical-set.md) that decides what the animals will be in five years' time, and it is the reason the dairy herd renews itself, the flock gains growth, and a population carries a resistance.

## Formulation

### What technical element type does this technical instance belong to?

**The Livestock Breeding And Genetics Set belongs to the `Technical Element Set` technical element type — a collection of technical elements scoped to one bounded field, which here is the genetic change of an animal population.**

It is a set and not a `General Technique` because a mating, a collection, a transfer, a genotyping, and an index computation are different technical element types, and because the one that does the deciding — selection — is an inference from records rather than an act. The `Technical Element Set` grouping below the root is admitted by the No-repetition exception and appears once. Secondary readings, kept as prose: an AI centre or a transfer clinic is a `Production Technical System`; one insemination of one ewe is an `Operative Technique`; heritability, the generation interval, and the genotype-by-environment structure are a `Technical Domain Reality Model` (decomposed in the root spine). No row carries two types.

### What is this technical instance?

> The whole apparatus by which an animal population is made over generations: the sires and dams chosen, the matings performed (naturally, by artificial insemination, or by moving embryos), the progeny and genomic records kept, the offspring weighed and indexed against contemporaries, and the candidates selected — so that the population's mean for a stated trait rises, measurably, generation over generation.
>
> The discipline is an argument with a biological clock. Selection can only be as fast as the animal's age at first breeding, so the generation interval sets the ceiling on progress; progress is also proportional to accuracy and to selection intensity; and both are bought with something, accuracy with recording, intensity with inbreeding. The whole set is the machinery for managing that trade.

**Why selection on animals is a different act from selection on plants.** On a plant, the individual selected is the individual that reproduces. On an animal, the merit of the individual is only knowable from the mean of its progeny, and the selection decision must be made before that evidence exists, or on a prediction that stands in for it. Every technique here — progeny test, genomic selection, embryo biopsy, differential test — is an attempt to decide sooner, on weaker evidence, and the accuracy figures are the honest statement of how weak.

**The central trade.** A population selected hard for production becomes uniform, and a uniform population has less capacity to respond to whatever the next change turns out to be. Selection therefore also selects away the variation that a later problem would have needed, which is the same tension the crop-side set faces in a different way, and is why inbreeding monitoring and genetic-trend evaluation are members here rather than afterthoughts.

Lineage: choosing the breeding animal by eye → writing the pedigree → weighing progeny and keeping the best → crossbreeding to combine → artificial insemination, which turns geography and herd size into a mating detail → embryo transfer, which separates a dam's genetics from her production → genomic selection, which decides before the animal has bred once → gene editing, in the species whose regulation permits it.

### What is the recursive instance decomposition of this technical instance?

> Boundary: one ensemble at middle depth — the spine (evolution, purpose, reality model) and the breeding, insemination, record, and embryo technologies worked to instance leaves. No exemplars are carried: a farm's own index figures belong in its own decomposition.
>
> Typing reads from the instance path: the spine lands on flat facet types; the technologies resolve to the nearest enclosing type segment. Expansion is licensed by `(root) -> <<Technical Element>> -> ... -> Technical Element Set`. Every backticked type segment groups instances and terminates on none; every leaf resolves to a technical instance.
