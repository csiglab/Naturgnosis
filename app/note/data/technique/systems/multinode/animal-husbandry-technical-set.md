# Animal Husbandry Technical Set

> The **Animal Husbandry Technical Set** is the system, where [Dairy Husbandry Set](note.html?n=technique/systems/multinode/dairy-husbandry.md) is one of its specialisms. It holds the animal side of [Food Production Technical Domain](note.html?n=technique/systems/multinode/food-production-technical-domain.md): everything an animal-production enterprise must do to turn an animal into a product while the animal remains alive, and to replace the animals it uses.
>
> It is the mirror of [Plant Cultivation Technical Domain Set](note.html?n=technique/systems/multinode/plant-cultivation-technical-domain-set.md), and the mirror is exact enough to be useful and inexact enough to matter. The crop stands in the field for its season and is sown again; the animal is a long-lived individual, it must be fed and housed and kept in health continuously, it reproduces or it does not, and the system's output is bounded by how fast it can replace itself. That single difference — continuous holding and self-replacement, rather than seasonal growth and annual sowing — is what makes animal technique a discipline of systems rather than of operations.

## Formulation

### What technical element type does this technical instance belong to?

**The Animal Husbandry Technical Set belongs to the `Technical Element Set` technical element type — a collection of technical elements scoped to one bounded field, which here is the production of food from animals.**

It is a set and not a single `Production Technical System` because housing, rationing, mating, veterinary work, and welfare practice are different technical element types that co-operate inside one enterprise and that no one of them substitutes for. The `Technical Element Set` grouping below the root is admitted by the No-repetition exception and appears exactly once. Secondary readings, kept as prose: a barn or a paddock system is a `Production Technical System`; one handling or one treatment of one animal is an `Operative Technique`; the carrying capacity, the nutrient cycle, and the animal's own physiological limits are a `Technical Domain Reality Model` (decomposed in the root spine). No row carries two types.

### What is this technical instance?

> An animal-production enterprise: livestock, poultry, or fish held on land or in water; fed from pasture, forage, or a formulated ration; housed, handled, and recorded; bred so that the next generation is better than the last; guarded against disease by vaccination, biosecurity, and culling; and worked to a welfare standard that is now a condition of being allowed to sell. The output is meat, milk, eggs, fibre, or fish, and the system exists to produce that output while renewing itself.

**The constraint that makes animal technique different.** A plant is a factory that gets rebuilt every season; a herd is not. The animal is a capital asset with a fixed productive life, and the enterprise is a pipeline. So the decisive figures are not the output of the best animal but the output of the average animal over its life, the age at which a female enters the herd, and the proportion that leaves involuntarily. Production technique here is mostly the technique of not losing the animals.

**The three member sets that carry the biology.** Breeding decides what the next generation is and is decomposed in the [Livestock Breeding And Genetics Set](note.html?n=technique/systems/multinode/livestock-breeding-and-genetics.md). Health decides whether the animal is still there, and is decomposed in the [Animal Health Technical Set](note.html?n=technique/systems/multinode/animal-health-technical-set.md). Feeding decides what the animal can convert, and is held here, because the ration and the pasture are husbandry rather than health. The species systems — the lactating herd, the meat and egg flock, the fish farm — are the members through which the whole set reaches an actual animal.

**Welfare is a stated objective, not a by-product.** The welfare domains are separately measurable, the standards are audit criteria, and the market now prices access to them. This is a change in the system's purpose, not a change in sentiment about it, and it is why welfare practice sits inside the technical decomposition rather than beside it.

Lineage: pastoral animals moved with the seasons → fixed housing and hand feeding → intensification by selection, formulated ration, and veterinary medicine together → confinement at high density, raising output and the welfare question → precision husbandry with per-animal records → a state presence through welfare, antimicrobial, and traceability rules rather than through price.

### What is the recursive instance decomposition of this technical instance?

> Boundary: one system at middle depth — the spine (evolution, purpose, reality model), the infrastructure, feeding, and welfare practice groups worked to instance leaves, and five member sets, each of which is elaborated in its own note or reserved for a later decomposition. Members are named and their scope stated, not re-decomposed here.
>
> Typing reads from the instance path: the spine lands on flat facet types; each member resolves to the enclosing `Technical Element Set` grouping. Expansion is licensed by `(root) := <<Technical Element>> -> ... -> Technical Element Set`. Every backticked type segment groups instances and terminates on none; every leaf resolves to a technical instance.

| Instance Tree Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Technical Element Set` → Animal Husbandry Technical Set | The animal-production system: housing, feeding, breeding, health, welfare, and handling, composed from the member sets that carry each of them. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Animal Husbandry Technical Set → `Technical Evolution` | Grouping: the technical evolution of this set. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Animal Husbandry Technical Set → `Technical Evolution` → Pastoral Husbandry Era | Animals moved with the herd, live off the land, and slaughtered when the season ended them. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Animal Husbandry Technical Set → `Technical Evolution` → Fixed-Housing Era | The animal kept in one place and fed, so its production stops depending on the season. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Animal Husbandry Technical Set → `Technical Evolution` → Intensification Era | Selection, controlled mating, formulated rations, and veterinary medicine applied together, with output per animal rising faster than output per hectare. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Animal Husbandry Technical Set → `Technical Evolution` → Confinement And Welfare-Conflict Era | Animals kept indoors at high density, which raises output and raises the welfare question the standards now answer. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Animal Husbandry Technical Set → `Technical Evolution` → Precision Era | Sensors on the animal and the environment, individual records, and management decisions made per animal rather than per herd. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Animal Husbandry Technical Set → `Technical Evolution` → Regulatory Era | The state entering the system through welfare, antimicrobial, identification, and environmental rules rather than through price. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Animal Husbandry Technical Set → `Technical Purpose` | Grouping: the technical purpose of this set. |
