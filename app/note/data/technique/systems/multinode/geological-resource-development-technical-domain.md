# Geological Resource Development Technical Domain

*Aprovechamiento de Recursos Geológicos*

> The **Geological Resource Development Technical Domain** is the super-domain that composes every technique for turning a geological occurrence into a usable mineral product and, afterwards, into a closed and remediated site. It is not a practice of its own: it is the scope inside which the member sets sit, and its work is to say what they share, where each one begins, and where the domain stops.
>
> The cut is the full chain. What is in: finding the occurrence (prospecting and exploration), taking the rock out of the ground (extraction, open-pit and underground), separating the valuable fraction (beneficiation and first processing), and returning the site (closure and remediation). What is out: everything upstream of technique — the deposit as observer-independent furniture, which belongs to nature — and everything downstream of the marketable product — firms, concessions, and markets, which belong to the social and production spaces — as well as the earth sciences as knowledge, which belong to epistemica.

## Formulation

### What technical element type does this technical instance belong to?

**The Geological Resource Development Technical Domain belongs to the `Technical Element Set` technical element type — a collection of technical elements scoped to one bounded field, which here is the full-chain development of geological resources.**

Technical Element Set
└── Geological Resource Development Technical Domain (bounded field: occurrence → marketable product → closed site)
```

It is a set rather than a `Production Technical System` because it owns no pit, no plant, and no concession: the members own those, and what this scope adds is the family and its boundary. That is the same move as the [Technical Core Catalog](note.html?n=technique/technical-core-catalog.md), which is the corpus's existing precedent for a set whose members are themselves sets; here the member family is the full-chain development techniques rather than the transformation domains.

The `Technical Element Set` grouping below the root is admitted by the No-repetition exception: it scopes the instance family of the member sets that would otherwise hang untyped off the root's own segment, and it appears exactly once. Composite members take the `Set` suffix at this depth. No row below carries two types.

**Why these four and not others.** Petroleum Oil is deliberately **not** a member. It is a resource, not a technique for developing one: composing a technical domain out of a resource node would put the worked object inside the working. Metalworking is out for the mirror reason on the downstream side: cutting, forging, and welding shape an already-produced metal, which belongs to fabrication rather than to resource development. Materiotecnia stays out as knowledge scaffolding: the chemical and physical investigation of material systems informs the processing member but is not itself a development technique. The sector view of the same material — concessions, firms, royalties, markets — is held in the social and production spaces.

Secondary readings, kept as prose rather than compromise typing: a single mine, quarry, or well field is a `Production Technical System`; one blast, one drilling campaign, or one leaching cycle is an `Operative Technique`; the deposit, the orebody geometry, and the grade distribution the extraction side works in are a `Technical Domain Reality Model`. Each takes its own root in its own decomposition.

### What is this technical instance?

> A super-domain, not a workings: the exploration member finds the occurrence, the extraction member takes the rock out, the processing member separates the valuable fraction, and the closure member returns the site; and this scope holds them together by the single transformation they perform — a geological occurrence is made to yield a product, on a schedule, to a specification, and the ground is left closed.

**What the members share, and what they do not.** The shared thing is the transformation, not the commodity and not the technique. Exploration works in belief — its success is a warranted location, judged like the [Well Logging](note.html?n=technique/well-logging.md) dual reading at the Observation Interface; extraction and processing work in matter — tonnage moved, grade recovered; closure works in liability — a site that can be left. They are one domain because a tonne of copper concentrate, a cubic metre of dimension stone, and a barrel-equivalent of industrial mineral are produced the same way in form — occurrence, campaign, product window, specification — even though exploration is bounded by geology and access while extraction is bounded by geotechnics, safety, and permits. That difference is carried in the reality model below rather than smoothed away.

**The state of the members, stated plainly.** This domain is composed of sets in uneven conditions. Well Logging is a worked dual-reading decomposition (39 rows); Mining System (9 rows), Metals Production (8), and Nonmetallic Production (7) are Produceologia seed stubs. The honest consequence is twofold: the Mining System stub, as written, claims the whole exploration-to-recycling ecosystem rather than extraction, so it overlaps its siblings instead of sitting inside its own set; and the metals note pairs upstream smelting with downstream cutting, forging, and welding, so part of what it holds belongs to fabrication and sits outside this domain's boundary. The Closure Set does not exist at all — no node, no note. So the domain as composed is strongest at the borehole, broad-stubbed in the middle, and missing its end, and it says so rather than presenting an even frontage it does not have.

**The gap this creates, and its remedy.** Closure and remediation are uncovered, and extraction proper — the pit, the stope, the drill-and-blast cycle as distinct from the ecosystem stub — has no decomposition of its own. The remedy is to write them, and the member rows above are shaped to receive them: each already names what it holds and what it is currently missing. The Closure Coverage Requirement below records the gap as a requirement on the domain rather than leaving it to a reader to notice.

Lineage: surface gathering and shallow digging → prospecting by outcrop and float → drilling and systematic sampling → geophysics and geochemistry → open-pit and underground mechanization → flotation, leaching, and solvent extraction → automation and remote operation → closure engineering and remediation, with the parallel regulatory line running from concession custom to the modern permit, royalty, and closure-bond regime.

### What is the recursive instance decomposition of this technical instance?

> Boundary: one super-domain, decomposed at middle depth — the root, its four member sets, and the spine that states what the members share (evolution, purpose, reality model, the requirements and standards the whole field is bounded by). No member is re-decomposed here: each has its own note, and repeating a member's contents inside its parent is duplication, not structure.
>
> Typing reads directly from the instance path: the members resolve to the enclosing `Technical Element Set` grouping; the spine lands on flat facet types. Expansion is licensed by `(root) := <<Technical Element>> -> ... -> Technical Element Set`, the recursion rule for that composite. Every backticked type segment groups instances and terminates on none; every leaf resolves to a technical instance.

| Instance Tree Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Technical Element Set` → Geological Resource Development Technical Domain | The full-chain domain: the techniques that turn a geological occurrence into a marketable mineral product and return the site closed, composed from the member sets that carry each of them. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Geological Resource Development Technical Domain → `Technical Element Set` | Grouping: the four member sets of the full-chain domain. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Geological Resource Development Technical Domain → `Technical Element Set` → Exploration Set | Finding the occurrence before it is touched: prospecting, geophysics, geochemistry, drilling and sampling, and the borehole formation measurement of well logging. Worked dual-reading decomposition, 39 rows. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Geological Resource Development Technical Domain → `Technical Element Set` → Extraction Set | Taking the rock out of the ground, open-pit and underground: the workings, the drill-and-blast cycle, loading and hauling. Seed node, 9 rows — a Produceologia stub, and as written it claims the whole exploration-to-recycling ecosystem rather than sitting inside its own set. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Geological Resource Development Technical Domain → `Technical Element Set` → Beneficiation And Processing Set | Separating the valuable fraction: crushing, grinding, flotation, leaching, smelting, refining, and the glass, cement, and ceramics lines. Seed nodes, 8 and 7 rows — Produceologia stubs, and as written the metals half also holds downstream cutting, forging, and welding, which belong to fabrication outside this boundary. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Geological Resource Development Technical Domain → `Technical Element Set` → Closure Set | Returning the site: decommissioning, tailings and waste stabilization, water treatment, revegetation, and post-closure monitoring. No node and no note yet — a named future set, required by the coverage requirement below. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Geological Resource Development Technical Domain → `Technical Evolution` | Grouping: the technical evolution of this domain. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Geological Resource Development Technical Domain → `Technical Evolution` → Gathering Era | Rock taken where it lies at the surface, the first technical act that makes a geological material rather than a found stone. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Geological Resource Development Technical Domain → `Technical Evolution` → Prospecting Era | Outcrop, float, and the prospector's reading of the ground, without any theory of why the showing is where it is. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Geological Resource Development Technical Domain → `Technical Evolution` → Drilling Era | The borehole as the instrument of proof: systematic sampling turning a showing into a measured occurrence. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Geological Resource Development Technical Domain → `Technical Evolution` → Mechanization Era | The pit and the stope mechanized — drilling jumbos, shovels, trucks, and hoisting — turning extraction from labour into throughput. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Geological Resource Development Technical Domain → `Technical Evolution` → Concentration Era | Flotation, leaching, and solvent extraction moving recovery from the visible mineral to the chemistry of the pulp. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Geological Resource Development Technical Domain → `Technical Evolution` → Automation And Closure Era | Remote operation and autonomous haulage at the working face, with closure engineering and remediation becoming a designed phase rather than an abandonment. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Geological Resource Development Technical Domain → `Technical Purpose` | Grouping: the technical purpose of this domain. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Geological Resource Development Technical Domain → `Technical Purpose` → Supply Purpose | The domain's end: mineral product, in quantity and in grade, from a geological occurrence rather than from synthesis or recycling. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Geological Resource Development Technical Domain → `Technical Purpose` → Stewardship Purpose | The ground left closable: a site that can be decommissioned, stabilized, and monitored, so that development is a campaign with an end rather than an open liability. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Geological Resource Development Technical Domain → `Technical Domain Reality Model` | Grouping: the technical domain reality model of this domain. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Geological Resource Development Technical Domain → `Technical Domain Reality Model` → Orebodies And Occurrence Geometry | The operative model of the domain: grade, tonnage, and geometry bounding what an occurrence can be made to yield. Where the model ends is where this domain ends. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Geological Resource Development Technical Domain → `Technical Domain Reality Model` → Geotechnical And Hydrogeological Reality | The operative model of the extraction side: rock strength, structure, water, and gas bounding how the ground can be opened and held open. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Geological Resource Development Technical Domain → `Technical Domain Reality Model` → Campaign Window | The operative model all members share: permits, seasons, prices, and access fixing a window in which the occurrence can be worked, which cannot be widened by technique alone. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Geological Resource Development Technical Domain → `Technical Requirement` | Grouping: the technical requirement of this domain. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Geological Resource Development Technical Domain → `Technical Requirement` → Marketability Requirement | The product must be in a state that can be sold to specification — the requirement that separates resource development from moving rock. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Geological Resource Development Technical Domain → `Technical Requirement` → Closure Coverage Requirement | The domain requires a decomposed set for closure and remediation; until that exists, the end of the chain is uncovered and every campaign downstream of extraction ends in an undescribed liability. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Geological Resource Development Technical Domain → `Technical Standard` | Grouping: the technical standard of this domain. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Geological Resource Development Technical Domain → `Technical Standard` → Resource Classification Standard | The rule that turns drill intercepts into stated tonnage and grade, and therefore fixes what the extraction regime must deliver. |
| `Technical Element Set` → Geological Resource Development Technical Domain → `Technical Standard` → Safety And Closure Bond Standard | The stated conditions under which ground may be opened and must be left, which the extraction and closure members are bounded by and exploration is not. |
