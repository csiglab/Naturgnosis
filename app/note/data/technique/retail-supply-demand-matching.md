# Retail Supply–Demand Matching

> **Retail Supply–Demand Matching** is the operative system through which a retailer keeps shelves filled: sensing demand, planning orders, allocating scarce supply, and learning from stockouts and substitutions. Source: the three-space reading developed in the ambiguity guide (`guideline/ambiguity_resolution.md`).

## Formulation

### Which readings does this instance carry?

| Space | Root type | Tree |
| --- | --- | --- |
| technique (primary) | `Technical Practice` | Demand planning and replenishment: tasks, techniques, acts, ensemble |
| social (secondary) | `Social Compound` | Retail ensemble: units, roles, norms, coordinators, dynamics |
| epistemic (secondary) | `Concrete Epistemic Artifact` | Demand estimate: interfaces, artifacts, feedback, standards |

### What technical element type does this technical instance belong to?

> **This instance's primary belonging is `Technical Practice` (technique space)** — the repeatable, organized pattern of sensing demand and replenishing shelves. It is readable as a `Social Compound` (social space: the retail ensemble whose coordination it serves) and as a `Concrete Epistemic Artifact` (epistemic space: the demand estimate its sensing task produces). Each reading grows its own well-formed tree below, typed by its own grammar; no row carries two types (`guideline/ambiguity_resolution.md`, multi-root note rule).

### What is this technical instance?

> One retailer's closed loop of demand sensing, order planning, and shortage allocation: register sales become a demand estimate; the estimate becomes orders and quotas under lead times; stockouts and substitutions feed back into the next estimate. Boundary: one matching system, decomposed at middle depth — full intermediate structure through the declared roots, exemplars only where a branch needs one.

### What is the recursive instance decomposition of this instance under technique?

> Identity: Instance Tree Path is the stable identifier of each row; every path is unique. Typing reads from grouping segments and the declared root binding (`Technical Practice`).

### Nature substrate

> The goods moved (cucumbers, substitutes) and their conditioning (cold chain, ripening rooms) decompose naturally — as `Natural Object`s, `Substance / Matter`, and `Natural Process`es at the appropriate level of organization — not here. This note cross-links that reading instead of growing a fourth tree (`guideline/ambiguity_resolution.md`: canonical multi-root note).
