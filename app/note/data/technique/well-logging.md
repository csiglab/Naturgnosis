# Well Logging

> Well logging is technical in means but epistemic in goal: a borehole is drilled and wireline
> sondes are lowered to measure the geological formations around it. The intervention succeeds
> when it yields warranted belief about what lies underground — judged by confirmation,
> predictive yield, and reproducibility — not by transformation performance. Decomposed twice,
> once per reading, per `guideline/ambiguity_resolution.md`:
> the means under the technical grammar, the end under the epistemic grammar, cross-linked
> at the Observation Interface. No row ever carries both types.

## Formulation

### What technical element type does this technical instance belong to?

Default root: a `Technical Element Set` — the **well logging practice** (drilling, conveyance,
transduction, and recording organized to evaluate a formation). Readable as an epistemic
endeavor whose product is formation knowledge; that reading grows its own tree below rather
than a compromise type.

### What is this technical instance?

**Well logging**: the organized method of drilling a **borehole** and lowering **wireline sondes**
on a **logging cable** to transduce formation properties (natural radioactivity, resistivity,
acoustic slownness, density) into continuous **log curves** indexed by depth, for formation
evaluation. The cut includes the rig, the tool string, the borehole, and the recording chain;
it excludes the drilling-for-production operation and the reservoir-investment decision, which
consume the logs but belong to other readings.

### What is the recursive instance decomposition of this technical instance?

types `` `code` ``; every leaf resolves to a technical instance.
