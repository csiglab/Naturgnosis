# OpenAPI Specification (OAS)

> OpenAPI is a language-agnostic standard for describing HTTP APIs as machine-readable contracts, consumable by humans and tooling alike.
>

> It is the complement of an implementation: the OpenAPI document states the intended interface (paths, operations, schemas, security) while servers, clients, and gateways realize it.
>

> This note treats OpenAPI as a full ecosystem — the versioned specification plus its documents, annotations, generators, validators, renderers, and practices — following the schema in [Philosophia Artium Technicarum et Operis](note.html?n=general/philosophia-artium-technicarum-et-operis.md).

## Formulation

### What technical element type does this technical instance belong to?

**OpenAPI belongs to the `Technical Standard` technical element type — a set of versioned specs — readable as a `Technical Element Set`.**

More specifically:

```text
Technical Standard
└── OpenAPI (umbrella standard — OAS 2.0 / 3.0 / 3.1)
    readable as Technical Element Set (spec + documents + tooling + practices)
```

OpenAPI is a standard because it is a normative specification governing the form, function, interoperability, and behavior of API description documents. It is itself a set: versioned spec documents (Swagger 2.0, OAS 3.0, OAS 3.1) grouped under one umbrella. A tool (validator, generator, renderer) *implements* the spec; a running server, gateway, or generated client *realizes* a described interface. As a coherent body of standard + blueprint documents + objects + techniques + institutions organized around one capability — specify, produce, validate, document, and consume API interfaces — it can also be read as a `Technical Element Set`.

### What is this technical instance?

> OpenAPI is a versioned, serialization-independent standard instance for machine-readable HTTP API contracts — describing paths, operations, parameters, request/response bodies, schemas, and security in JSON or YAML — together with the document format, tooling, and contract-first/code-first practices that generate code, validation, documentation, and gateway enforcement from a single source.

Lineage: Swagger 2.0 (Wordnik/SmartBear) donated to the OpenAPI Initiative (Linux Foundation, 2015) → OAS 3.0 (2017) → OAS 3.1 (2021, full JSON Schema alignment).

### What is the recursive instance decomposition of this technical instance?

> Boundary: this table decomposes one OAS 3.x ecosystem instance (standard, document format, spec objects, tooling, practices, control, governance); deployment-specific values appear only in rows marked exemplar.
>
> Stopping rule: a row is terminal when it names a concrete spec version, a named OAS object field, a file, a named tool, a config attribute, or a named actor.
>
> Identity: Instance Tree Path is the stable identifier of each row; every path in this table is unique.
>
> Verbs: a tool *implements* the standard; a server, gateway, or generated client *realizes* a described interface.

## Configuration

> `swagger-config.yaml` — configuration of Swagger UI, one *realizing* renderer from the decomposition above, not of OAS itself.

Swagger UI provides several configuration options that allow you to customize its behavior and appearance when documenting your APIs. Here's a list of some common Swagger UI options and their descriptions:

1. **url**:
    - Specifies the URL to the Swagger/OpenAPI definition file (JSON or YAML) that Swagger UI should use for documentation.
2. **urls**:
    - Allows you to provide multiple URL definitions, enabling you to switch between different API versions or services in the same Swagger UI instance.
3. **oauth**:
    - Enables OAuth 2.0 authorization support in Swagger UI, allowing users to authenticate and access secured API endpoints.
4. **validatorUrl**:
    - Specifies the URL of an external Swagger validator service. This is used to validate the Swagger/OpenAPI definition against a schema.
5. **docExpansion**:
    - Controls the initial state of the documentation sections. Options include "list," "full," "none," or "fullOnStartup."
6. **defaultModelRendering**:
    - Defines how models are initially displayed. Options include "model," "schema," or "example."
7. **displayRequestDuration**:
    - Specifies whether to display the request duration (response time) for each API request.
8. **filter**:
    - Allows you to apply a filter to the API operations to display only a subset of endpoints.
9. **operationsSorter**:
    - Controls the sorting of API operations in the UI. Options include "alpha," "method," or a custom function.
10. **tagsSorter**:
    - Defines the sorting of tags in the UI. Options include "alpha" or a custom function.
11. **deepLinking**:
    - Enables deep linking to specific sections of the documentation, which updates the URL as you navigate through the documentation.
12. **showExtensions**:
    - Displays vendor extension fields (fields not part of the official OpenAPI specification) in the UI.
13. **displayOperationId**:
    - Specifies whether to display the operation ID next to each operation in the UI.
14. **defaultModelExpandDepth** and **defaultModelsExpandDepth**:
    - Set the default depth for models and model schemas that are expanded by default.
15. **tryItOutEnabled**:
    - Controls whether the "Try it out" functionality is enabled for making API requests directly from the UI.
16. **showCommonExtensions**:
    - Displays common extensions (fields defined by Swagger/OpenAPI extensions) in the UI.
17. **useRequestInterceptor** and **useResponseInterceptor**:
    - Allows you to specify custom JavaScript functions to intercept and modify API requests and responses.
18. **configUrl**:
    - Specifies a URL to an external configuration file to customize Swagger UI settings.
19. **layout**:
    - Specifies the layout of the UI. Options include "BaseLayout," "StandaloneLayout," or a custom layout class.
20. **onComplete**:
    - A JavaScript callback function that is executed when Swagger UI has finished loading.

These options can be set when configuring Swagger UI in your ASP.NET Core or Node.js application. Depending on your use case and requirements, you can customize Swagger UI to suit your needs by configuring these options accordingly.
