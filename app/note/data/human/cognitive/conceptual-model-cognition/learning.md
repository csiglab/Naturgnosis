# Learning

> Learning is **the process of**  acquiring (training / changing your brain) to incorporate new knowledge, skills, behaviors, or understanding **through** study, experience, or teaching. Learning is a  **heterogeneous** phenomena - many **types of learning process** (not generic way to learn everything).
>

> The **skill of learning things** fast is a multiplier, it has an exponential impact in other activities. Humans process meta-cognition so they can alter and improve the learning process (also we  have R&D / Science).
>

> **Learning**: The process by which we acquire new knowledge or skills through experience, observation, or instruction,

## Index

## Formulation

> **Learning** is a **computationally mediated, experience-dependent modification** of an **agent’s internal representational structures** and **functional mappings (a fancy way to say operate better)**, occurring through neurobiological or symbolic substrate updates, which result in **non-random, adaptive changes** in the system’s ability to predict, infer, decide, or act within a given environment.
>

Formally, let an agent be described by a tuple $A = \langle R, M, P, U \rangle$, where:

- $R$ is a representational space (e.g., beliefs, models, schemas);
- $M$ is a set of mechanisms (e.g., neural networks, symbolic rules) for information processing;
- $P$ is a performance function $P: R \times E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, mapping representations and environments $E$ to performance;
- $U$ is an update function $U: R \times E \times O \rightarrow R$, where $O$ is the set of observed outcomes.

Then **learning** occurs when: $\exists \, t_1, t_2 \in \mathbb{T}, \, t_1 < t_2 \; \text{such that} \; R_{t_1} \neq R_{t_2} \; \text{and} \; P(R_{t_2}, E) > P(R_{t_1}, E)$ under the constraint that changes in $R$ are due to updates from $U$ driven by interaction with $E$, not by random noise.

## Learning Research

> Learning research is a multidisciplinary field within cognitive science, psychology, neuroscience, and education that explores how individuals acquire, process, and retain knowledge and skills. It examines cognitive mechanisms, environmental influences, and instructional methods that impact learning.

## QA

### What  are the different cognitive states archieve after learning?

| State | Key Cognitive Signature | Typical Time Scale | Observable Markers |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Initial Encoding | High working-memory load, fragile explicit trace | Seconds–minutes | Can reproduce only with hints; frequent errors |
| Early Consolidation | Hippocampal replay, trace stabilization | Minutes–hours | Performance drops sharply if disrupted by new tasks |
| Proceduralization / Component-Fluency | Compiled routines, reduced error rate | Hours–days | Faster RT, fewer errors, less verbal mediation |
| Explicit-to-Implicit Transition | Declarative → implicit conversion | Days | “Know how” without “know what”; difficult to verbalize steps |
| Schema Formation & Generalization | Higher-order mental models | Days–weeks | Successful transfer to isomorphic problems |
| Automaticity | Minimal attention demand, dual-task resistant | Weeks | Task runs in parallel; Stroop-like interference vanishes |
| Metacognitive Awareness | Accurate self-monitoring & study strategies | Weeks–months | Self-pacing study, error detection without feedback |
| Adaptive Expertise | Deep, conditionalized, flexible knowledge | Months–years | Innovates procedures; solves novel problems |
| Expert Intuition | Rapid pattern recognition | Years | Immediate “gut” answers; high accuracy under time pressure |
| Long-Term Retention / Permastore | Neocortical storage, hippocampal independence | Years–decades | Retrieval after years with little relearning; low forgetting slope |

### How people Consumes Information?

> Approaches and patterns by which individuals or organizations access, process, and utilize information from diverse sources and formats.
>
- **[Exposition] Linear/Feed/Personalized/Curated/Discovery Model (Stuff Get Push To Me) (Indirected) :** These models involve the delivery or discovery of information in a structured, predetermined manner (linear or feed), tailored to individual preferences (personalized), handpicked by experts (curated), or serendipitously encountered (discovery).
- **[Necesity] On-Demand/Interactive/Search-Based Model (I Look It Up) (Directed):** These models emphasize user-driven access to information, allowing users to request specific content as needed (on-demand), engage with content interactively (interactive), or actively search for data using queries (search-based).
