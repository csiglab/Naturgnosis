## Genome Structure

> The complete set of genetic material in an organism, including all of its genes and non-coding sequences.
>

> **Size**: Varies widely between organisms (e.g., bacteria have smaller genomes compared to eukaryotes).
>

> **Density**: Eukaryotic genomes are less densely packed due to the presence of introns and non-coding regions, while prokaryotic genomes are more compact.
>

> **Repetitive Sequences**: Include transposable elements and satellite DNA, influencing genome evolution and stability.

### **Components of Genome Structure**

| **Component** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Chromosomes** | Large DNA molecules that contain genes; organized as linear structures in eukaryotes and circular in prokaryotes. |
| **Chromatin** | DNA packaged with histone proteins in eukaryotes, forming nucleosomes that compact into chromatin. |
| **Genes** | Functional units of heredity made up of sequences that code for proteins or functional RNA. |
| **Exons** | Coding sequences of a gene that are transcribed into mRNA and translated into proteins. |
| **Introns** | Non-coding sequences within a gene that are transcribed but removed during RNA processing. |
| **Regulatory Elements** | DNA sequences (promoters, enhancers, silencers) that control gene expression. |
| **5' Untranslated Region (5' UTR)** | The non-coding region upstream of the coding sequence that helps regulate translation. |
| **3' Untranslated Region (3' UTR)** | The non-coding region downstream of the coding sequence that affects mRNA stability and translation efficiency. |
| **Repetitive DNA** | Sequences that occur in multiple copies, including tandem repeats and transposable elements. |
| **Mitochondrial/Chloroplast DNA** | Small circular genomes found in organelles, inherited maternally in most species. |
| **Operon** | … |

### **Genome Structure in Different Organisms**

| **Organism Type** | **Genome Structure** |
| --- | --- |
| **Prokaryotes** | Typically consist of a single circular chromosome and may contain plasmids. |
| **Eukaryotes** | Composed of multiple linear chromosomes, with a more complex structure involving chromatin. |
| **Viruses** | Can have either DNA or RNA genomes, which can be single-stranded or double-stranded, and linear or circular. |
