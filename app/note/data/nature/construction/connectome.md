# Connectome

> An **epistemic construction about a natural target**: the wiring of one nervous system is
> observer-independent reality, and the connectome is the artifact built to describe it —
> nodes and edges at a stated parcellation and resolution, the graph model read off them,
> and the record of how they were reconstructed. The note is filed under `nature/` for
> navigability; its typing follows the epistemic grammar, and its natural target is cited,
> never decomposed here. Worked per [Philosophia Artium Epistemicarum et Operis](note.html?n=meta/philosophia-artium-epistemicarum-et-operis.md);
> the wiring itself belongs to [Philosophia Naturalis et Operis](note.html?n=meta/philosophia-naturalis-et-operis.md).

## Formulation

### What is this epistemic instance?

**Connectome**: the constructed connectivity of one nervous system, stating its
parcellation, its resolution, and the pipeline that produced it. What is **in**: the
dataset (node set plus edge list or connectivity matrix), the graph model used for
inference, the parcellation scheme that fixes what counts as a node, the reconstruction
record (specimen, modality, registration, segmentation, synapse detection, thresholds),
and the validation evidence. What is **out**: the synaptic wiring itself, which is the
natural target — a segment of reality that would exist unobserved, with or without any
map; the electron microscopes, scanners, and tracers, which are instruments; and the
labs, consortia, and funders, which are social actors. No row below carries two types.

Two scales are kept apart because they are two artifacts, not one: the **micro
connectome** (C. elegans, 302 neurons; adult Drosophila, about 140,000 neurons; larval
zebrafish whole brain) resolves individual neurons and synapses, while the **macro
connectome** of the human brain resolves regions and tracts, at about 86 billion neurons
and 10^14 synapses beneath the parcellation.

### What epistemic element type does this epistemic instance belong to?

**`Epistemic Construction`** — the kind of element produced to organize, preserve, explain,
or extend knowledge about a target, here a concrete artifact (`<<Epistemic Construction>>`:
a dataset with its model and record) rather than a type. Its standing is `Validated` only
against the criteria and resolution it states: a connectome is warranted as an edge claim
at a given parcellation, threshold, and reconstruction method, not as the wiring in itself.

### Is the type of this `epistemic element instance` ambiguous?

**Yes, in two ways, and both are resolved rather than merged.**

First, the word names three different things: the **artifact** (this note), the **target**
(synaptic wiring, a natural segment — filed under the naturalis grammar), and the **field**
(connectomics, an epistemic activity with its own tools and standards, a row below). Only
the artifact is documented here.

Second, artifact versus representation: the connectivity matrix and the connectogram are
an `Epistemic Representation` — the sign system in which the artifact's content is encoded
— while the artifact's element type is `Epistemic Construction`. The guide settles the
overlap — an epistemic representation is also a construction — so the primary type is
Construction, and the encoding is decomposed as its representation layer. No compromise
type is introduced.

### What is the recursive instance decomposition of this epistemic instance?

> Boundary: one artifact, decomposed at middle depth — the target it describes, its
> dataset, model, scheme, and record, its encoding, its interfaces and registrations,
> the pipeline and method that produce it, the standards and constraints that judge it,
> the gap that bounds it, and the infrastructure that supports it. Deeper expansion is a
> separate decomposition per artifact (dataset, model, pipeline).
>
> Identity: every Instance Tree Path is a valid prefix of the tree, and the placeholder is
> rebound per row — an artifact row from `Epistemic Construction`, an interface row from
> `Observation Interface`, never both on one row.

| Instance Tree Path | Description | Epistemic Category | Epistemic Element Type Tree Path |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Connectome | The constructed connectivity of one nervous system at a stated parcellation, resolution, and pipeline. | Construction | `(root) := <<Epistemic Element>> -> Epistemic Construction` |
| Connectome → Synaptic Wiring | The bounded segment of reality described: neurons and their synapses. Natural target; not decomposed here. | Target | `(root) := <<Epistemic Element>> -> Epistemic Target -> Segment of Reality -> System` |
| Connectome → Connectome Dataset | Node set and edge list (or connectivity matrix) at the stated parcellation and resolution. | Construction | `(root) := <<Epistemic Element>> -> Epistemic Construction` |
| Connectome → Connectome Model | Graph-theoretic model read off the dataset: degree, hubs, modules, and the null models they are tested against. | Construction | `(root) := <<Epistemic Element>> -> Epistemic Construction` |
| Connectome → Parcellation Scheme | The convention fixing what counts as a node: region atlas, cell type, or individual neuron. | Construction | `(root) := <<Epistemic Element>> -> Epistemic Construction` |
| Connectome → Reconstruction Record | Provenance of the artifact: specimen, modality, registration, segmentation, synapse detection, thresholds applied. | Construction | `(root) := <<Epistemic Element>> -> Epistemic Construction` |
| Connectome → Graph Notation | Adjacency matrix, edge list, and connectogram: the sign system the artifact's content is encoded in. | Representation | `(root) := <<Epistemic Element>> -> Epistemic Representation -> Representational System` |
| Connectome → Electron Microscope | Boundary mechanism coupling tissue to registration at synapse resolution. | Access | `(root) := <<Epistemic Element>> -> Observation Interface -> Transduction` |
| Connectome → Diffusion MRI Scanner | Boundary mechanism coupling white matter to registration at region resolution. | Access | `(root) := <<Epistemic Element>> -> Observation Interface -> Transduction` |

| Connectome → Diffusion Volume | Registered diffusion volumes, the primary record of the macro artifact. | Access | `(root) := <<Epistemic Element>> -> Observation Record` |
| Connectome → Reconstruction Pipeline | Registration, segmentation, synapse detection, and graph extraction as one ordered procedure. | Methodology | `(root) := <<Epistemic Element>> -> Epistemic Activity (Process) -> Epistemic Tool` |
| Connectome → Connectomics | The organized method that makes the pipeline reproducible and comparable across specimens. | Agency | `(root) := <<Epistemic Element>> -> Epistemic Activity (Process)` |
| Connectome → Split-Half Reliability | Independent halves of the data must agree on edge presence and weight. | Validation | `(root) := <<Epistemic Element>> -> Epistemic Standard` |
| Connectome → Tracer Agreement | Independent tracing must agree on the edges it can reach. | Validation | `(root) := <<Epistemic Element>> -> Epistemic Standard` |
| Connectome → Resolution–Coverage Constraint | Synapse resolution and whole-brain coverage cannot both hold in one artifact. | Validation | `(root) := <<Epistemic Element>> -> Epistemic Constraint` |
| Connectome → Threshold Sensitivity | Edge claims change with the threshold, and must be stated with it. | Validation | `(root) := <<Epistemic Element>> -> Epistemic Constraint` |
| Connectome → Human Micro-Scale Gap | No complete human connectome exists at synapse resolution. | Target | `(root) := <<Epistemic Element>> -> Epistemic Gap` |
| Connectome → Reconstruction Compute | Compute and storage that make the artifact producible at all. | Support | `(root) := <<Epistemic Element>> -> Epistemic Infrastructure` |

## QA

### What is a critical conceptual evaluation of this epistemic instance?

> The artifact's standing is method-conditioned throughout. Which nodes exist is decided by
> the parcellation, so hub and module claims move when the atlas changes; which edges exist
> is decided by the threshold and the reconstruction pipeline, so density and weight claims
> carry those choices with them. Split-half reliability certifies consistency within one
> pipeline, not correspondence to the wiring; tracer agreement certifies it only where
> tracing reaches. The most serious risk is reification — treating the matrix as the brain
> and the edges as anatomical facts rather than as warranted claims at a stated resolution.
> The bound is the human micro-scale gap: complete connectomes exist for a handful of small
> nervous systems, and every human claim is regional and approximate. The construction is
> therefore `Validated` for the scope it declares, and silent outside it.
