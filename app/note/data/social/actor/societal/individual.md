# Individual

> An individual, as an economic interaction unit, is a bounded agent capable of making decisions, perceiving constraints, and acting purposefully within an economic system by allocating resources, forming preferences, responding to incentives, and participating in exchanges—either as a consumer, producer, worker, investor, or regulator—based on internal dispositions and external institutional conditions.

> An economic individual is a context-sensitive interaction unit endowed with internal preferences, behavioral dispositions, and constraints, capable of perceiving, evaluating, and acting within structured economic environments through adaptive and relational processes.

## Behavior

> Behavior is the observable expression of an entity’s internal dispositions as it interacts with its environment over time. It reflects the structured sequence of actions or responses performed by an interaction unit in relation to stimuli, goals, norms, and constraints.

### Preference

> Preferences are internal dispositional structures within an agent that rank or evaluate potential states, actions, or outcomes relative to one another, thereby guiding choice behavior in the presence of alternatives.

#### Definition

**Set of alternatives (or consumption bundles):**
  Let $X$ be the set of all possible alternatives (e.g., bundles of goods, outcomes, choices).

**Preference relation:**
  A preference relation $\succeq$ is a binary relation on $X$, where for any two alternatives $x, y \in X$,

  $$
  x \succeq y
  $$

  means "alternative $x$ is **at least as preferred** as alternative $y$."

#### Formulation


**Types of Preference Relations**:

* **Strict preference**:
  $x \succ y$ means $x \succeq y$ but not $y \succeq x$ (i.e., $x$ is strictly preferred to $y$).

* **Indifference**:
  $x \sim y$ means $x \succeq y$ and $y \succeq x$ (i.e., the decision-maker is indifferent between $x$ and $y$).

#### Properties of Preference Relations

A preference relation $\succeq$ often satisfies:

* **Completeness:**
  For all $x, y \in X$, either $x \succeq y$ or $y \succeq x$ (or both).
  This means the agent can always compare any two alternatives.

* **Transitivity:**
  For all $x, y, z \in X$, if $x \succeq y$ and $y \succeq z$, then $x \succeq z$.

* **Reflexivity:**
  For all $x \in X$, $x \succeq x$.

#### Utility Function Representation

If preferences satisfy the above properties (completeness, transitivity, and often continuity), then there exists a **utility function**:

$$
u : X \to \mathbb{R}
$$

such that for all $x, y \in X$,

$$
x \succeq y \iff u(x) \ge u(y).
$$

This means the agent’s preferences can be represented by assigning a real number $u(x)$ to each alternative, so the preference ordering matches the ordering of these numbers.

### Utility

> Utility is a quantitative abstraction representing the degree to which an agent's preferences are satisfied by a particular outcome, state, or good; it serves as a formal measure used to evaluate and compare alternatives within decision-making processes.

> Ontologically, utility is not a concrete object or a directly observable phenomenon. It is a modeling construct that encodes the evaluative stance of an agent within a specific choice context, derived from preferences, and designed to support predictive or normative analysis of behavior.
