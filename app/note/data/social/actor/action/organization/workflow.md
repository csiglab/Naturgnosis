# Workflow

> **Workflow** is the defined sequence of steps routing work among actors and roles — the organization form that turns a repeated doing into a repeatable route: who does what next, on which trigger, under which rule, into which state.

## Formulation

### What social element type does this social instance belong to?

**Workflow belongs to the `Workflow` social element type (Action category, `Action Organization` branch, Synontic layer)** — a defined route existing through the shared recognition of its actors. It is distinct from `Process / Event` (a temporally extended transformation), from `Plan` (a one-off arrangement it may repeat), and from `Interaction Pattern` (a recurring sequence it may formalize).

### What is this social instance?

> The routed doing: a trigger starting it, steps ordered, actors and roles named, a routing rule deciding each next move, and states marking progress. Workflows decompose into their kinds and their anatomy; the route is the instance, the repeatability the form.

### What is the recursive instance decomposition of this social instance?

> Boundary: one organization family, decomposed at middle depth — kinds and anatomy only.
>
> Stopping rule: a row is terminal when it names a workflow kind or an anatomy element.
>
> Identity: Instance Tree Path is the stable identifier of each row; every path is unique.
